`freecad_convert_shape.py` came from [here](https://gist.github.com/mdeweerd/d14274ac53b64f23d983b5fdabed8f9e), which in turn was forked from somewhere else. Since it's been distributed as gists without clear license files, I am assuming (optimistically) that these files are public domain or something. @mdeweerd @slazav correct me if I'm wrong.
